	An array is a object, like all in C#. This class 'Array' belongs to the System namespace    ->  System.Array
	you make some searches on the internet (preferably on the  API of .NET) you can see that:
		1.Is a public and a abstract class.		
		2.Is the daughter of the class Object.
		3.Implements the interfaces :
                	*ICollection
                	*IEnumerable
                	*IList
                	*IStructuralComparable
                	*IStructuraIEquatable
                	*ICloneable
    
    You can read all about the class Array on the .NET API, but here i write the most common examples and codes,
    i hope you enjoy ;)
